# Interface

Target text field takes the values of Right Ascension, Declination and Field of View in degrees; all seperated by spaces OR common name, messier ID, etc.. In the case of latter, a fixed FoV of 20 degrees is used to narrow down the plot.
<br /><br />
RESET CHART will reset the plot to what it was initially on opening the interface.
<br /><br />
MESSIER SIZE buttons will either increase or decrease the size of all messier objects; increments have no limit but the decrease button will not have affect once the size reaches the initial value.
<br /><br />
HOPS CREATED button will display the list of messiers for whom hops have been created; this includes the ones from previous sessions.
<br /><br />
CREATE HOP will prompt user to enter messier ID to which hops are to be made; prompt reappears if the object is unidentified. Once the messier ID is resolved it appears in the region above the plot indicating that the user can start creating hops.
<br />*Entering a messier ID in the prompt following the CREATE HOP button will not change map; Target text field or the navigation buttons are to be used to narrow on the messier object.*
<br />UNDO HOP will delete the last marker star in the current hop; can be used till all marker stars are deleted.
<br />FINISH HOP will prompt user for *Further Instruction* nad then the hops along with string input will be saved in the dictionary and the dictionary is pickled.
<br />*If FINISH HOP is clicked without recording any marker stars, an empty list is assigned to that particular messier object in the dictionary; If the particular messier already had hops in the dictionary, it will be overwritten now with an empty list(This is a method to clear existing hops).*
<br />
<br />A seperate program will form a csv from the dictionary. The messiers with empty lists will be disregarded at this juncture.

# Instructions for Creating Hops for Messiers After clicking on CREATE HOP
Messier ID is entered; hops must be recorded in the order towards the messier object minus the messier object.
<br />So, if a star A and Star B are selected; the hopping is from A to B to Messier Object.
<br />
**CAUTION: EVERYTIME YOU NOTICE AN UNWANTED HOP IN THE DISPLAY ABOVE THE PLOT, CLICK UNDO. THIS HAPPENS ESPECIALLY  WHILE ZOOMING/PANNING USING THE DEFAULT NAVIGATION BUTTONS AS THEY ARE RECORDED AS A MOUSE CLICKS.
NEXT UPDATE SHOULD SEE A CHANGE IN THIS BEHAVIOUR.**

**ANY DEVIATION IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF PROGRAM FROM WHAT'S DESCRIBED, LET ME KNOW**
